## 🌱 Introduction
**EcoSmart** is a sustainability-focused platform designed to encourage eco-friendly shopping habits. It features a **browser extension** that analyzes products on e-commerce websites and assigns an **EcoScore** based on various environmental factors such as waste, plastic usage, and overall environmental impact. If a product has a low score (i.e., is not eco-friendly), it recommends better alternatives.

The **web app** complements this by allowing users to claim rewards based on their EcoPoints, fostering a greener shopping experience.

> 🌍 **"If people stop buying non-natural products, manufacturers will cease production, reducing waste and promoting sustainability for a better future."**

## 🎯 Features
- 🛒 **EcoScore Extension**: Analyzes e-commerce products and rates them based on eco-friendliness.
- ♻️ **Eco-Friendly Recommendations**: Suggests sustainable product alternatives.
- 🎁 **Web App Rewards**: Users can claim rewards based on their accumulated EcoPoints.
- 🌍 **Sustainability Awareness**: Encourages responsible consumption and production.


## 🤔 Why I Chose This Project & How I Generated the Idea
The idea came to my mind because e-commerce is a daily necessity, and in this era, it is crucial to be mindful of our purchases. While I had many options to choose from, I decided to think outside the box and focus on a solution that benefits the world. By selecting this project, I aimed to align with the sustainability theme and contribute to a better future by encouraging responsible consumer behavior.
